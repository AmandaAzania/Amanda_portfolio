      Amanda Gudlwa is known to me for the past four weeks as a colleague of
      Life Choices Coding Academy. <br> Even outside the classroom, Amanda is a
      wonderful friend to be with.  He holds a good conversation, very
      informative, <br> full of fun and more importantly warm and concerned. Amanda
      would be a credit to any developer team whatever its level.
